        <h1>What is a DDoS Attack?</h1>
        <p class="lead">A straightforward, human-friendly explanation of distributed denial-of-service attacks: what they are, how they affect systems, and approachable steps to reduce risk.</p>
      </div>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Quick definition</h2>
      <p style="color:var(--muted)">A <strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</strong> attack is when many computers or devices send huge amounts of traffic or requests to a website, app, or network to overwhelm it. The result is that legitimate users can't use the service — it becomes slow or completely unreachable.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="grid">
      <div>
        <h2>How it works (plain English)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Attackers direct lots of devices (commonly a botnet) to hit one target at the same time.</li>
          <li>That flood can fill up bandwidth, crash services, or tie up server resources so real users can't get through.</li>
          <li>Sometimes the traffic is random noise; sometimes it's crafted to exploit a weak part of the system.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Common flavours</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Volumetric:</strong> massive amounts of data to saturate the network link.</li>
          <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> abusing the way network protocols work to exhaust servers or firewalls.</li>
          <li><strong>Application-layer:</strong> hitting specific app endpoints (like logins) so the app itself runs out of steam.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your site becomes slow or times out for many users at once.</li>
        <li>Traffic metrics spike dramatically from many different IPs or countries.</li>
        <li>Monitoring tools show saturated links, growing queues, or suddenly high error rates.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Practical protection — what teams do</h2>
      <p style="color:var(--muted)">Below are practical, high-level protections commonly used by organisations. They’re deliberately non-technical so you can understand options when you speak with your host or security provider.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a CDN or a managed DDoS mitigation service to absorb and filter attack traffic before it reaches your origin servers.</li>
        <li>Apply rate limits and simple filters at the edge to drop obviously malicious requests.</li>
        <li>Run a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for application-layer protection and caching to reduce load.</li>
        <li>Keep an incident response plan and contact your host or ISP immediately if you see signs of an attack.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="recommend" role="note" aria-live="polite">
        <strong>Host recommendation:</strong>
        <p style="margin:6px 0;color:var(--muted)">If you want a host that focuses on strong DDoS protection and fast incident support, consider using <strong>WINGMAN</strong> as your provider. WINGMAN positions itself as a host with built-in mitigation and responsive support channels — a good choice if uptime during an attack is a priority. (Always compare providers, ask for specifics about traffic scrubbing, and check real customer reviews before committing.)</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What to do if you're hit</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact your host or CDN immediately and give them timestamps and logs.</li>
        <li>Follow their mitigation instructions — they can often route traffic through scrubbing centres quickly.</li>
        <li>Avoid any retaliation. Retaliation is illegal and rarely helps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">This page exists to inform — not to instruct on how to launch attacks. Carrying out or assisting with DDoS attacks is illegal and unethical.</p>
